Word
    Create a list of strings, form a list, then choose a word at random
Guess
    Compare the input to the individual letters in the word

First: Choose a random word - set the word as private to protect it from being re-written
generate output: dashes corresponding to the length of the word.
Ask for a letter - go to Guess
    After the input is assessed, we will either have success or failure. 

    Success: Replace the dash with the proper letter
    Failure: The parachute loses a dash

Output: "The letter {guess} is/is not in the word"
print the parachute again.

End of game: 
    isPlaying is true until: The game ends with guessing the word, or the parachute is gone.
