    public void Draw

    I guess we need to start out with a card, make a guess, then make another draw.
    We would write out a random draw (1, 14)
    The next card isn't displayed until the guess has been made. 

  }
    
This will be a separate file.

For the Director:

public class Director
  {
   current card
   next card 
  }
