// Gem Drop Program

// First thing that's different from rbf is that the "robot" is now a basket or some kind of gem 
// catcher, and it can only move side to side, not up and down. Those functions will need to be 
// changed. What is the Y axis range of the screen? Set an origin for the basket at an X0 = 0, and 
// Y0 = to the bottom-most value. Y Max is 600 units. so that would make Y0 = -600 for the basket?
// Or is that -300? Origin for RFK is 0, 0 and that is the middle of the screen. 
// X Max is 900. So same question there. 

// I think the cast is limited to just the basket, gems, and rocks, right? So I can set the basket 
// equal to an underscore. The gems equal to an asterisk. The rocks equal to a zero. As for colors? 
// I don't think that matters? 

// Okay, start the program:
// RBF has all of the code for the window, so let's just use that. I need to get my gems and rocks
// to have an origination point and then appear and start falling. Set them on a time lapse? and 
// How to get them to fall? 

// When they are collected, they will return a message at the top of the screen, which will be a 
// running "Total Score". Rocks are -1 point, and Gems are +1 point. Start at whatever number of 
// points, and the game is over when you reach X number of points (You Win!), or get down to 0 
// points (You lose!).
